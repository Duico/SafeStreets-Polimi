\section{Formal Analysis using Alloy}
\subsection{What we want to model?}

Using Alloy we want to show possible scenarios in which the system can be and we also want to test its correctness.
In particular we are interested in show the following things:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User send Reports
    \item Authority access the Report by the ReportManager
    \item Authority can generate TrafficTickets
    \item TrafficTicket refer to a Report
    \item Report is about a violation made in a Location of a Municipality
    \item Authority can generate TrafficTickets only for violations made in the same Municipality they belong to.
    \item SuggestionsManager take data form ReportManager and form Municipality to cross them and create suggestions. Both User and Authority can access SuggestiosManager to read suggestions about possible improvements
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Alloy generated Worlds}
    \vspace{10px}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{\textbf{Simple case}}: Here we can see the case in which a User has sent a Report, an Authority has verified it and a TrafficTicket has been generated.\\\\
        To obtain this world representation the line of Alloy code about the SuggestionsManager are not executed, while the code for the execution is the following:
        
\begin{minted}{alloy}
    pred show{
        #User = 1
        #Authority = 1
        #TrafficTicket = 1
        #Report = 1
    }
    
    run show for 3
\end{minted}
        
        \begin{figure}[h]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Images/alloy_simple.png}
        \end{figure}
        
        \vspace{40px}
        
        
        \item \textit{\textbf{More Entities}}: In this case we can see the same things as before but in a more complex situation because there are more Entities. Here we can also notice that the Authority can generate a TrafficTicket only to Reports made in the Municipality he belongs to.
        There also is a Report (Report0) in which there is no association we a TrafficTicket. This means that it can be not checked yet or it is verified but the TrafficTicket will be generated after.\\\\
        Here again the code about SuggestionsManager is not executed and the execution code is:
        
\begin{minted}{alloy}
    pred show{
        #User = 3
        #Authority = 2
        #TrafficTicket = 2
    }
    
    run show for 3
\end{minted}

\vspace{1cm}
        
        \begin{figure}[h]
            \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Images/alloy_complex.png}
        \end{figure}
        
\newpage
        \vspace{30px}
        
        
        \item\textit{\textbf{Allows Suggestions}}: This World represent the complete scenario.
        There is what we have discuss before and the insertion of a SuggestionsManager which collect data from Municipalities and Reports (via ReportManager) and cross them to create Suggestion on how to improve urban mobility.
        Both Users and Authorities can access it to read them. Even if a User never send a Report can look at the Suggestions.\\\\
        In this last case the code about SuggestionsManager is executed and to get the model representation the code is:
        
\begin{minted}{alloy}
    pred show{
        #User = 3
        #Authority = 2
        #TrafficTicket = 2
    }
    
    run show for 3
\end{minted}
